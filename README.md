# Layer Cloner script for InDesign

If you have ever worked with InDesign documents that needed to be produced in other languages, you are likely to have encountered the need to copy an entire layer from one InDesign document to another.

This script allows you to copy one layer and its elements from one document to another.

Download the script from here https://redokun.com/blog/indesign-copy-entire-layer-one-file-another 

## Installation

1. Download the script file (layer-cloner.jsx, libs.jsx).
2. Open Adobe InDesign.
3. Choose **Window** > **Utilities** > **Scripts**.
4. In the **Scripts** panel, right click on User and choose Reveal in Finder (Mac) or Reveal in Explorer (PC).
5. Copy the script files (e.g., “layer-cloner.jsx” and“libs.jsx”) inside the **Scripts Panel** folder.


## Run the script

- In InDesign: open the source and destination files.
- Make sure that the two documents have the same number of pages (and make sure that the source document is the one visible)
- Double-click on layer-cloner.jsx in the Script Panel in InDesign.
- Select the layer you want to copy and select the file you want to copy it into.


## Notes

Please be aware that the script doesn't copy the items in the master spread.
